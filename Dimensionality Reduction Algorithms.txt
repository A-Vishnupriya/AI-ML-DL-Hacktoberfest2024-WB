Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
In today's world, vast amounts of data are being stored and analyzed by corporates, government agencies, and research organizations. 
As a data scientist, you know that this raw data contains a lot of information - the challenge is to identify significant patterns and variables.

Dimensionality reduction algorithms like Decision Tree, Factor Analysis, Missing Value Ratio, and Random Forest can help you find relevant details.
Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques for reducing the number of input variables in training data. When dealing with high dimensional data, 
it is often useful to reduce the dimensionality by projecting the data to a lower
dimensional subspace which captures the “essence” of the data.

Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:-
   Feature selection. 
   Feature extraction. 
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
   Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) 
   Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) 
   Generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) 
   Missing Values Ratio. 
    Low Variance Filter.
