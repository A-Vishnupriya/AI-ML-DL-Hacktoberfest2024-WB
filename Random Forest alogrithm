Random Forest Algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm which could be used for both Regression and Classification problems.

It's an ensemble learning technique as it combines the results of individual decision trees to arrive at the optimum output.

Individual decision trees show a high degree of variance in their individual results.

Hence Random Forest is a more optimized method than refining individual decision trees.

Example:-We can use Random Forest algorithm to suggest an optimum choice of crops to be grown on a field based on soil health and weather statistics. As every crop has specific requirement of soil nutrients anf pH level as well as different requirements of weather conditions like humidity, rainfall etc.

We can train Random Forest algorithm to learn the co-relation between different climatic and soil conditions required for specific crops and can use the results to predict an optimum choice of crops to be grown based on the input provided by the farmer on soil health and weather statistics for maximum yield and maximum profit.
